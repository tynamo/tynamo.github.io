Sorry, fans of Tynamo.org (both of you, just wanted to say hi :), we've been gone for a few weeks. Tynamo.org was another casualty of Codehaus's demise. We were running on top of Codehaus' Confluence-based infrastructure and after they went bust, we had to figure out a different platform. Luckily we had already moved the code over to Github over a year ago, so now we "only" need to rebuild the documentation and transform it to Markdown powered by Jekyll. Currently, we have just rudimentary site, we'll be adding more content in the coming weeks. Thanks for patience!
