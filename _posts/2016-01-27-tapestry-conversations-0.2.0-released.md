title: tapestry-conversations 0.2.0 released!
---
We aim to serve. A user asked for a T5.4 compatible version of conversations module and we delivered. Upgrading the module was pure joy and it is a testament to the outstanding backwards compatibility record T5 has had throughout its existence. Note that I had written the original version for Tapestry 5.0 while we were still called the Trails framework! Checkout the [tapestry-conversations guide](http://www.tynamo.org/tapestry-conversations+guide/) for more info.
