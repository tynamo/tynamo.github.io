title: Tynamo goes Github!
---
GitHub is cool and we so desperately want to be cool too that we decided Tynamo needs to be there as well. In all seriousness, Dragan Sahpaski wrote up a whizbang script to import all of the Tynamo's SVN history, branches etc. to a Git repo so it made the move a no-brainer. Thanks Dragan. We still love Codehaus though and they'll continue providing a lot of the infrastructure support, like CI builds and Confluence space but we are going to moving issue management over to Github as well so we can be ready for your pull requests instead of writing the code ourselves :) Also because we are good Git citizens, each Tynamo module now has its own Git repo. Checkout the [Tynamo's organization page at Github](https://github.com/tynamo) and navigate from there to your preferred module and start forking away!
