title: tapestry-model 0.6.0 released!
---
Finally, we have an officially compatible release tapestry-model for T5.4 available. We had one long running issue with the changes in tapestry core and it wasn't until T5.4-rc1 before it was all sorted out. The official release note is here but there's been lots of great functional changes to the core.

**Release notes**

- Fix the test suite to use changed form element names [#4](https://github.com/tynamo/tapestry-model/issues/4)
- 0.5.2 has a dependency on eclipselink [#2](https://github.com/tynamo/tapestry-model/issues/2)

Here's a few screenshots of the brand spanking new tapestry-model in action (just to put down any potential qualms abouts us doing nothing but smoking weed all day long here). Also notice the search options.
